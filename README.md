Objective overview
IRON-GUARD’S PRESTIGIOUS TIMEPIECE
This is the name of the famous brand store, found in the east side of the country (South Africa) in Mpumalanga ‘The place of the rising sun’ province. In the capital city of Mbombela Nelspruit, where it was born. The name symbolises the iron steel craftmanship and how the beautiful art is laid upon your wriest and it formally came as a dream and passion to offer not just luxury watches, but timeless value. I wanted a name that will reflect the essence of power and luxury in watches such as, Strength, leadership, precision, and elegance. Iron guard Prestigious Timepiece (IPT) sells timeless top tier brand watches from luxury to entry level watches, they formalise themselves as a Vintage wealth prestige group that makes them elite in the game of watches.
History
Iron guard Prestigious Timepiece was established by an inspiration of the first ever watch gifted to me on a birthday, this was the first time being amazed by a wristwatch. This is where the love began and research and study all formed and later had the ability to get my first Rolex Daytona “(launched in 1963, the Cosmography Daytona has long since transcended its status in the world of watchmaking to become an icon)”. This timepiece became the birth of the establishment in 2001 where the first trade was made when I went to a watch collector auction house and bid for a Cartier and sold it to make a start-up market. The Rolex watch was the foundation of the love of watches, the aura and discipline it had on the kind of people that owned it and made me very thrilled and eager to learn why and what makes the brand this expensive.

The Rolex Daytona, first released in 1963, was built for professional racers, featuring a water-resistant Oyster case, a tachymetric scale, and the Valjou 72 movement. It became a cultural icon in the 1970s when Paul Newman popularized it—his personal 6239 even sold for an incredible $17.8 million in 2017. Today, models like the 116500LN come with a tough Cerachrom bezel and Rolex’s high-tech Caliber 4130 movement. With its racing heritage, limited production, and status as a collector’s dream, the Daytona remains one of the most sought-after luxury watches in the world.
