<p>Purpose 
    The main purpose is to drive the market even higher as there are few Agents and dealers here in South Africa, 
    in the last year over 2% increase in value did markup go and this where I believe it will help the growth on (IPT) and bring in more publicity making it a well-rounded dealer in the country and boost the global trade markup in overall.
    </p>
    <p>Imagine yourself taking a study break at two in the morning, coffee in hand, as you explore our website and envision the watch you will buy when you secure your first significant job. We designed Iron-guard's website to serve as a supportive companion rather than a cold, polished catalog. It embodies the understanding that luxury transcends mere price tags; it encompasses the thrill of unboxing a long-awaited package and the quiet pride that accompanies owning something that truly reflects your identity. 
        Through the enhancement of our online visibility, the cultivation of trust, and the provision of a smooth purchasing process, 
        we aim to position Ironguard as the leading choice for luxury timepieces. 
        Alongside educating our clients and expressing our passion for exquisite watches, we will utilize SEO strategies, social media engagement, and informative content to attract watch aficionados, offer expert advice, and ensure that buying, selling, or trading is both straightforward and secure.
