    <h1>Welcome to Irong-Guard PRESTIGIOUS TIMEPIECE</h1>
    <h2>About US</h2>

    <p>Iron guard Prestigious Timepiece was established by an inspiration of the first ever watch gifted to me on a birthday, this was the first time being amazed by a wristwatch. This is where the love began and research and study all formed and later had the ability to get my first Rolex Daytona “(launched in 1963, the Cosmography Daytona has long since transcended its status in the world of watchmaking to become an icon)”.
         This timepiece became the birth of the establishment in 2001 where the first trade was made when I went to a watch collector auction house and bid for a Cartier and sold it to make a start-up market. 
         The Rolex watch was the foundation of the love of watches, 
         the aura and discipline it had on the kind of people that owned it and made me very thrilled and eager to learn why and what makes the brand this expensive.</p>
